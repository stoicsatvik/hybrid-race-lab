# Foundry State

## Objective
Build an open-source race-performance analysis system for hybrid/endurance athletes that converts raw splits into bottleneck ranking, pacing insight, target-time simulation, and reproducible race debriefs.

## Public boundary
Public: generic schemas, parsers, analysis math, visualizations, examples, tests and athlete-owned local data workflows.
Private: proprietary athlete datasets, private coaching heuristics, private commercial recommendation engines, credentials, and any future paid intelligence layer.

## V0 milestone
- Typed race model: run / station / transition segments
- CSV/JSON/manual split ingestion
- Total-time decomposition
- Baseline-normalized segment deltas
- Bottleneck ranking by plausible time-saving opportunity
- Target-time simulator
- Exportable race debrief
- Deterministic fixtures and tests

## Acceptance
Given one race and one comparison baseline, the tool must reproducibly explain where time was lost, how sensitive that conclusion is to baseline assumptions, and what combinations of segment improvements can reach a requested finish time.

## Initial evidence target
Use public or synthetic HYROX-style split examples only. Do not fabricate athlete performance data or claim causal training advice from race splits alone.

## Next move
Inspect the Expo bootstrap, separate a framework-agnostic `src/core` analysis layer from UI code, define the race schema, and add deterministic unit tests for total-time decomposition and segment-delta ranking.
